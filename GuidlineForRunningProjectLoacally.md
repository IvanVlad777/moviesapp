If you want to run this aplication on your pc, you have to first own you api key.
This is little guide for how to do it.

## Get API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/

2. Creat account
3. Go to your profile icon and find settings
4. On the left sidebar search for API
5. Request for API key
6. Find it below _API Key (v3 auth)_ and copy it

## Creating .env file

1. To run this application locally you first need to create _.env_ file in main folder of aplication (not in src or public folder)
2. Inside .env file type REACT_APP_API_KEY=
